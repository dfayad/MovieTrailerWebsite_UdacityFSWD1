================================

To run the project you can download the zip file, expand it, then click the fresh_tomatoes.html file.

Another way to do it is to open EntretainmentCenter.py (make sure fresh_tomatoes.py and media.py are 
on the same working directory) and then run it.

All of the movies displayed are great, I highly recomend watching all of them.
